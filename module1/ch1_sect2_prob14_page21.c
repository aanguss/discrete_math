 * Description -
    At the local ice cream shop, you may get a three-way 
    sundae with up to three of the 10 flavors of ice cream; 
    any one of three flavors of topping; and any (or all, 
    some, or none) of whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. 
    How many different sundaes are possible? (In accordance 
    with your motherâ€™s rule from Problem 11 in Section 1.1, 
    the way the scoops sit in the dish does not matter.)
