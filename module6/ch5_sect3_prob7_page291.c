 * Description - 
 *  A nickel, two dimes, and two quarters are in a cup. You draw three 
 *  coins, one at a time, without replacement. Draw the tree diagram 
 *  that represents the process. Use the tree to determine the probability
 *  of getting a nickel on the last draw. Use the tree to determine the 
 *  probability that the first coin is a quarter, given that the last coin
 *  is a quarter.
