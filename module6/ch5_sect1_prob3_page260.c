 * Description -  
 *  If you hash three keys into a hash table with 10 slots, what is the
 *  probability that all three keys hash to different slots? How big does
 *  n have to be so that if n keys hash to a table with 10 slots, the
 *  probability is at least 1/2 that some slot has at least two keys hash
 *  to it? How many keys do you need to have probability at least 2/3 that
 *  some slot has at least two keys hash to it?
